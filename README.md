# PyPet
Simple python beginner game

This is my first upload. I'm a new programmer looking for tips and advise on the way 
I have written this code.It is a build up of thinkful's beginner sample PyPet, hence the name, lol

The game is set up with the classes Stats, Pets, Setup. Stats holds all the data pertaining to the pet. 
Pet holds the create pet functions including pet types and initial stats. The 3rd class, Setup, is where 
most of the code executes from. This class has 3 main functions, start_menu, begin, play. Start_menu holds 
the options for option for creating a new pet and continueing with 1 of the previous pets. begin holds the 
options for saving and quiting with a option continue to pass on to play. Play holds the heart of the game. 
It has the 5 options for interacting with your pet, which include feeding, playing, sleeping, and 2 options 
for giving attention. Each of the 5 options have a positive and negitive response from the pet, givin at 
random intervals. There is also a 3rd response that the pet can give but this happens very rarely because 
ive added it in as more of a easter egg then an actual responce. Can you find it? 

This is still in development but the code is complete and fully operational. I am currently working on 
combining start_menu and begin. I would also like to create pet type specific functions oppsed to the set 
options i currently have. Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated
