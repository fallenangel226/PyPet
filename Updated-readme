The code has been updated to reflect some of the changes i wanted to make. I added in the ability to have unique 
gameplay menus for each type of pet and i compacted some of the more repetitive code into functions for easier readablility.

  Functions im interested in working on now include having pets current pets interact with previously saved pets, probably 
only one pet pet instance, something like a one on one play date. I am also working on integrating turtle graphics into the program
to have a little animated picture on screen apposed to the txt based pic that i currently have coded.
